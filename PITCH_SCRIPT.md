# Dawayir Live Agent: Video Demo Script (4 Minutes)

**Goal**: Demonstrate the "Breathing Engineering" and "Magical Interaction" of the Gemini Live Agent.

---

### Phase 1: The Pitch (0:00 - 1:00)
- **Visual**: Close-up of the narrator (Muhammad) or a beautiful splash screen.
- **Narration**:
  - "Hello! I'm Muhammad, a designer and life coach. We are often overwhelmed by life's complexities—Work, Wellbeing, Truth—represented here as 'Dawayir' or Circles."
  - "Traditional AI is a chat box. But what if AI could *see* your mental model and physically manipulate it as you speak?"
  - "Introducing **Dawayir Live Agent**, built with Gemini 2.0. It's not just a bot; it's a breathing system."

### Phase 2: Live Interaction & Autonomous Move (1:00 - 2:30)
- **Visual**: Screen recording of the Dawayir Canvas.
- **Narration/Action**:
  - *Click 'Start Journey'*
  - "Hey Gemini, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed today. It feels like my 'Work' (Al-Ilm) is taking up too much space in my head."
  - **AI Action**: Gemini responds verbally *and* calls `update_node` to enlarge the 'Al-Ilm' circle and change its color to a stressful red.
  - "Notice how Gemini didn't just tell me it understood—it *changed the world* I'm looking at."

### Phase 3: The Interruption Stress Test (2:30 - 3:30)
- **Visual**: Still on the Canvas, showing the "Pulse" animations.
- **Narration/Action**:
  - Gemini starts explaining a philosophical concept about 'Truth'.
  - **User Interruption**: "Wait, wait! Actually, let's talk about 'Awareness' (Al-Wa'y) instead."
  - **AI Action**: Gemini stops mid-sentence, acknowledges the interruption immediately, and highlights (Pulse) the Al-Wa'y circle.
  - "This is the power of Gemini 2.0's VAD and low latency. The agent is truly alive and responsive to my immediate needs."

### Phase 4: Final Proof & Cloud Proof (3:30 - 4:00)
- **Visual**: Quick cut to Google Cloud Console (Cloud Run) showing the 'dawayir-live-backend' service.
- **Narration**:
  - "Everything you see is powered by a Node.js Maestro running on Google Cloud Run, proxying real-time streams to Gemini's Multimodal Live API."
  - "Dawayir is more than a demo; it's a scalable architecture for the next generation of AI companions."
  - "Let's kill ignorance with science. Thank you."

*Pro Tip: Use a high-quality microphone and ensure your internet connection is stable for the lowest latency during the demo.*
