## Bonus Point 1: Social Media Post 📱

### Requirements
- Platform: Twitter/X or LinkedIn (or both!)
- Required Hashtag: **#GeminiLiveAgentChallenge**
- Deadline: Before submission (ideally a few days before for engagement)

### Content Strategy

#### Option A: LinkedIn (Professional Audience)
**Post Template:**
```
🚀 Excited to share our submission to the Google #GeminiLiveAgentChallenge!

We built **Dawayir** (دوائر) — a Live Agent that combines real-time Arabic voice interaction with dynamic visual state manipulation.

🎯 What makes it unique:
✅ Real-time voice conversation using Gemini Live API
✅ AI-driven visual canvas updates via function calling
✅ Cloud memory persistence to Google Cloud Storage
✅ Egyptian Arabic language support for accessibility
✅ Deployed on Google Cloud Run with auto-scaling

The agent doesn't just talk — it actively transforms your mental clarity canvas as you speak, making abstract thoughts visible and actionable.

Built with Google GenAI SDK + Gemini 2.0 Flash Native Audio 🤖
