# 🚀 Final Action Plan to WIN the Gemini Live Agent Challenge

You're almost there! Everything we discussed is fully implemented. The code, the documentation, the infrastructure, and the core agent loop are complete and highly competitive. 

To cross the finish line, please follow these concrete daily steps to assemble your final Devpost submission.

## 1. Publish the Technical Blog Post (Bonus Points: +0.6)
We created a draft for you in `TECHNICAL_BLOG_POST.md`.
- **Action:** Publish this on Medium, Hashnode, Dev.to, or LinkedIn Articles. 
- **Action:** Add the hashtag `#GeminiLiveAgentChallenge` at the end.
- **Action:** Copy the URL of your published post and paste it into `DEVPOST_SUBMISSION.md` instead of `[ADD_BLOG_POST_URL_AFTER_PUBLISHING]`.

## 2. Generate the User Proof/Videos (30% of Score)
You must record a demonstration video that proves the system is "Live" and robust.
- **Action:** Use OBS Studio or Loom to record your screen and microphone.
